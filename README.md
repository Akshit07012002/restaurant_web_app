##Restaurant QR Menu Flutter Project

##Welcome to the ManageResto Restaurant QR Menu Flutter web project repository on GitHub! This repository contains the source code and resources for a Flutter-BLoC-based mobile application that serves as a digital menu for restaurants using QR code scanning.

# Features
• QR Code Scanning: Customers can scan a QR code placed on their table to instantly access the restaurant's digital menu on their mobile device.

Comprehensive Menu Details: Customers can view item descriptions, prices, and images, enabling them to make informed decisions.

• Customizable Orders: Users can easily customize their orders, select quantities, and add special instructions.
Fast and Accurate Order Placement: Orders are sent directly to the kitchen, minimizing errors and miscommunication.

• Contactless Dining: The touch-less nature of the app reduces the need for physical menus and minimizes face-to-face interactions, promoting hygiene and safety.
